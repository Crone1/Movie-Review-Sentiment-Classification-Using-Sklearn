# Overview

This repository contains my submission for assignment 2 in the module Natural Language Processing.

# Contents

The main file in this repo where all the work is done it the *movie_sentiment_classification.ipynb* notebook.
This notebook details my modelling process and uses the functions contained in the *Sentiment_classification_functions.py* file to create a model with high accuracy at classifying sentiment of movie reviews.

The Data folder contains the original data used in this modelling process but also contains the evaluation results of each of the models tested in this assignment.
